This was part of an assignment for a Video Game programming course.  Although it is very much under contruction it has 
all the code needed for much for more levels and a scoring system. For now you can shoot the enemy ship and the asteriods, I plan on improving the 
game loop, implement a scoring system, and new levels.

Use the arrows to navigate around the plane, press 'A' to shoot and 'Q' to quit the current session.
